TODO:

* Input of experimental data as opening screen just after Gaussian fit procedure
* Test submission beethoven and verdi
* Start implementing the fitting procedure:
    ** Number of scaling parameters
    ** Procedure for fitting ; see INOLLS
    ** or : full grid search in parameters space : only focusing on chemical element and not atom type for scaling lJ params initially

LATER
* Ask only once the common files
* Only one window for preparing CHARMM run
