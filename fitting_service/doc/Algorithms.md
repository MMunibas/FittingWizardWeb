## MTP Fit - Generating ##

**Source File:** mtp-part1.py

**Function to call:** mtpfit_part1()

**Input files:**
 * [name].xyz coordinate file

**Required parameters**
 * mtp_gen_filename_xyz name of uploaded xyz file

 * mtp_gen_molecule_multiplicity spin multiplicity of molecule
 * mtp_gen_gaussian_input_commandline e.g. MP2/aug-cc-PVDZ nosymm
 * mtp_gen_gaussian_num_cores number of cores to use for Gaussian job

**Generated output**
 * mtpfittab.txt fitting table file
 * (not yet complete)

## MTP Fit - Fitting ##

**Source File:** mtp-part2.py

**Function to call:** mtpfit_part2()

**Input files:**
 * mtpfittab.txt file generated by mtpfit_part1 in calculation output directory (do not upload)
 * generated_charges.txt file generated by web interface containing user-defined atomic charges
 * gdma_ref.pun file generated by mtpfit_part1 containing GDMA multipole moments

**Required parameters**
 * mtp_fitting_table_filename (file name of fitting table file from part 1, mtpfittab.txt)
 * mtp_fitting_threshold (user-defined fitting precision entered into web interface)
 * mtp_fitting_rank (rank of highest multipole moments to be fitted, entered into web UI by user)
 * mtp_fitting_flag_ignore_H (user web UI option to fit H-atoms or not, TRUE means don't fit)
 * mtp_fitting_charge_filename (generated_charges.txt file written by web UI to contain user-defined charges)
 * mtp_fit_number (which fit is this: 1st = 0, 2nd = 1, 3rd = 2...)

**Generated output**
 * fitted results file "fit_X.txt" in the local run output folder where "X" is the number of the fit
 * .pun and .lpun files containing fitted multipole moments in the local run output folder
