## LJ Fit ##

**Source File:** ljfit.py

**Function to call:** ljfit()

**Input files:**
 * [name].par CHARMM parameter file
 * [liq_name].pdb pure liquid PDB file
 * [solute_name].pdb solute molecule PDB file
 * [solvent_name].pdb solvent PDB file
 * [name].lpun MTPL punch file
 * [name].top CHARMM topology file

**Required parameters**
 * filename_charmm_topology (.top topology file for CHARMM)
 * filename_solute_pdb (.pdb structure file for solute molecule)
 * filename_solvent_pdb (.pdb file for solvent box)
 * filename_charmm_parameter (.par file for CHARMM)
 * filename_mtpl_lpun (.lpun file for CHARMM MTPL routine)
 * filename_pureliquid_pdb (.pdb file for pure liquid made of solute molecules)
 * ti_lambda_0 (initial lambda value for thermodynamic integration (usually 0.0))
 * ti_lambda_1 (final lambda value for thermodynamic integration (usually 1.0))
 * charmm_simulation_temperature (temperature for molecular dynamics simulations)

**Generated output**
 * molar_mass (solute molar mass)
 * pure_liquid_density (density of pure liquid)
 * vaporization_enthalpy (free energy of vaporization of pure liquid)
 * solvation_free_energy (free energy of solvation of solute molecule)

## MTP Fit - Generating ##

**Source File:** mtp-part1.py

**Function to call:** mtpfit_part1()

**Input files:**
 * [name].xyz coordinate file

**Required parameters**
 * filename_xyz name of uploaded xyz file
 * molecule_charge total charge of uploaded molecule
 * molecule_multiplicity spin multiplicity of molecule
 * gaussian_input_commandline e.g. MP2/aug-cc-PVDZ nosymm
 * gaussian_num_cores number of cores to use for Gaussian job

**Generated output**
 * mtpfittab.txt fitting table file
 * (not yet complete)

## MTP Fit - Fitting ##

**Source File:** mtp-part2.py

**Function to call:** mtpfit_part2()

**Input files:**
 * mtpfittab.txt file generated by mtpfit_part1 in calculation output directory (do not upload)
 * generated_charges.txt file generated by web interface containing user-defined atomic charges
 * gdma_ref.pun file generated by mtpfit_part1 containing GDMA multipole moments

**Required parameters**
 * mtp_fitting_table_filename (file name of fitting table file from part 1, mtpfittab.txt)
 * mtp_fitting_threshold (user-defined fitting precision entered into web interface)
 * mtp_fitting_rank (rank of highest multipole moments to be fitted, entered into web UI by user)
 * mtp_fitting_flag_ignore_H (user web UI option to fit H-atoms or not, TRUE means don't fit)
 * mtp_fitting_charge_filename (generated_charges.txt file written by web UI to contain user-defined charges)
 * mtp_fit_number (which fit is this: 1st = 0, 2nd = 1, 3rd = 2...)

**Generated output**
 * fitted results file "fit_X.txt" in the local run output folder where "X" is the number of the fit
 * .pun and .lpun files containing fitted multipole moments in the local run output folder
